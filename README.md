# Project-D (D Pastries Corner Website)

```
                          Project-D is a React project website replicating my sister's business

                        It was my first practice project on ReactJS and part of my stepping stones
                        towards my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.

                        This website is built using ReactJS + Vite, Node.js, and JavaScript
